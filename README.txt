PROJECT TITLE: Project3
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The program tests the student's skills to use input/output, exceptions, recursion and string manipulations
VERSION or DATE:11/26/2020
AUTHORS: Polina Ibragimova
STATE OF THIS PROJECT: The project works but for my taste it takes too long for the CompostionTwo class to run. If one waits I belive it works but it takes some time. 
I would like to improve this in the future.
PROCESS DESCRIPTION: The first 4 classes were easy but the last one was very hard. The only problem I had was with myWord class is that I could not figure out that when 
I implement comparable I have to specify the datatype. In Compostion Two the hard part for me was not checking if a word is compound or not it is keeping track of 
the subwords. I was not sure how to keep track of them first but then I figured out I can use the arraylist to keep track of the subwords. I did a lot of debugging with 
breakpoints but I did not immediately realize that I have to use binary search so the program origianlly only ran for the letters a and b. Now it runs for all the letters but it still 
takes too long for my standards.
